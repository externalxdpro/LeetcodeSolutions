// [621] Task Scheduler
// Difficulty: Medium

// You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and
// a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task.
// Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical
// tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.
// â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

// Example 1:
// Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
// Output: 8
// Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A ->
// B.
// After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The
// same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so
// you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

// Example 2:
// Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
// Output: 6
// Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
// With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other
// task.

// Example 3:
// Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
// Output: 10
// Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle
// -> idle -> A -> B.
// There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3
// intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

// Constraints:
//     1 <= tasks.length <= 10^4
//     tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
//     0 <= n <= 100
